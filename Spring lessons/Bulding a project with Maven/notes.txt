By default, all dependencies are scoped as compile dependencies. That is, they 
should be available at compile-time (and if you were building a WAR file, 
including in the /WEB-INF/libs folder of the WAR). Additionally, you may 
specify a <scope> element to specify one of the following scopes:

provided - Dependencies that are required for compiling the project code, but that
 will be provided at runtime by a container running the code (e.g., the Java Servlet API).

test - Dependencies that are used for compiling and running tests, but not
 required for building or running the projectâ€™s runtime code.
